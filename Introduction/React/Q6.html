        <h1> Q-6 What is Header and Content Components in React Js?</h1>
        <p > Ans:-</p><br>
        <p>The Header is an important element of a website's design. It's the first impression of 
            the website. It provides useful links to other areas of the website that the user may want 
            to visit. In this article, we will create a functioning Header using React JS and Material UI. <br><br>
            A header is a section at the top of a page that displays site name and navigation. React is 
            the most popular frontend library for developing component-driven user interfaces. It's used 
            for developing single page, mobile, and server-rendered applications.

        <p>45 headers are developed with React. A header is a section at the top of a page that displays site 
            name and navigation. React is the most popular frontend library for developing component-driven user
             interfaces. It's used for developing single page, mobile, and server-rendered applications.</p><br>
        <p>Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript
             functions, but work in isolation and return HTML. Components come in two types, Class components
              and Function components, in this tutorial we will concentrate on Function components.</p>
