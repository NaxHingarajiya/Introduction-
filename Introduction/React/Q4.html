        <h1> Q-4 What is CLI command In React Js?</h1>
        <p > Ans:-</p><br>
        <p>React has its own command-line interface (CLI) commands. However, these CLI commands are currently 
            only used to create a passable version of a react application using the command line. <br><br>
            CLI is a command line program that accepts text input to execute operating system functions.<br><br>
            A command line interface (CLI) is a text-based interface where you can input commands that interact 
            with a computer's operating system.
        </p> 
        <p style="font-size: 140%;">or</p>
        <p>More flexibility:The CLI provides granular control over build configuration and application 
            configuration, so you can customize performance and tailor the application to your specific needs 
            for future scaling. Potentially smaller app size: With more control over the included 
            libraries, you can build a simpler app.</p>
