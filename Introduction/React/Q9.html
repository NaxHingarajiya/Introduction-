        <h1> Q-9 How to change in components of React Js? </h1>
        <p > Ans:-</p><br>
        <p>To change the state of the React component is useful when you are working on a single page 
            application, it simply replaces the content of the existing component for the user 
            without reloading the webpage.  <br><br>

            We have to set initial state value inside constructor function and set click event handler of the 
            element upon which click, results in changing state. Then pass the function to the click handler 
            and change the state of the component inside the function using setState. The setState function 
            used to change the state of the component directly or with the callback approach as mentioned below.</p> 
        <p style="font-size: 140%;">or</p>
        <p>Sometimes, you want the state of two components to always change together. To do it, remove
             state from both of them, move it to their closest common parent, and then pass it down to them 
             via props. This is known as lifting state up, and it's one of the most common things you will do 
             writing React code.</p>
