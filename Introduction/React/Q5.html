        <h1> Q-5 What is Components in React Js?</h1>
        <p > Ans:-</p><br>
        <p>Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript
             functions, but work in isolation and return HTML. Components come in two types, Class components
              and Function components, in this tutorial we will concentrate on Function components.</p> 
        <p style="font-size: 140%;">or</p>
        <p >Every React. js component acts separately, so you can change one section of the app without 
            needing to update everything. This also means you can use the same component in each area of
            the app and change the individual pieces. There's less to update, so it makes the entire process
             far more efficient.</p><br>
        <p style="font-size: 140%;">or</p>
        <p>React lets you create components, reusable UI elements for your app. In a React app,
             every piece of UI is a component. React components are regular JavaScript functions 
             except: Their names always begin with a capital letter.</p>
