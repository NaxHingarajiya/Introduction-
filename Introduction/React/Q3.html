        <h1> Q-3 What is Role of Node Js in react Js?</h1>
        <p > Ans:-</p><br>
        <p>Remember, React renders UI components on the frontend, while Node. js manages server-side data communication. 
            The synergy between React and Node. js creates a cohesive and responsive web application.</p> 
        <p style="font-size: 140%;">or</p>
        <p >React nodes are a broader concept that includes React elements but also encompasses other 
            types like strings, numbers, and the special values null and undefined.</p><br>

        <h3>Main 9 Reasons to Use Nodejs with React:</h3>
        <p>
            1. High server load: Using Nodejs with React makes sense when your web application needs handling 
            of multiple requests and maintaining server load balance. <br><br>

            2. Real-time data: If your applicationâ€™s core is based on Real-time Data-Intensive management or 
            Data Streaming, using Nodejs is highly advisable for continued server connection. <br><br>
            
            3. JSON APIs: Building JSON APIs for your application is very efficient with Nodejs due to high code 
            reusability and easy code sharing in Reactjs.<br><br>
            
            4. Single Page Applications (SPA): Developing Single Page Applications in React while using Node to 
            build a lightweight backend model for asynchronous data loading through callback functions. <br><br>
            
            5. MERN stack: Nodejs can also be used with React with MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, and Nodejs) stack.<br><br>
            
            6. Scalability: Node and React enables developers to build multi-device, responsive, data-driven 
            web apps with scalability for large projects, ensuring optimal website performance across <br><br>
            various devices.
            
            7. Fast Development: Using React and Node for web app development yields high ROI, saving time 
            and money. These technologies excel in creating fast and easy-to-maintain websites.<br><br>
            
            8. Single Language for Front-end and Back-end: Using Node and React together, developers avoid 
            the need to learn complex back-end languages like Python or Ruby. They can use Node for 
            server-side development and React for front-end coding seamlessly, saving resources, money, and time.<br><br>
            
            9. Organized Process: The combo of React and Node streamlines web development. These scalable, 
            effective, and fast technologies work together to create high-functioning websites.<br><br>
